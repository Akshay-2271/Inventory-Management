## Aim 
The aim of this project was to make a completely working free program to deal with the invetory of a pharmacy and mechanize its various forms.
## Our Solution
Once the aim was established clearly, we needed to make a program through which a pharmacy can deal with the following-
* Customers
* Suppliers
* Invoicing aka bills generated 
* Reports(To maintain the record of medicines sold and bought on a daily/monthly/yearly basis)

While we were clear about the structure and what we wanted to do, the way to make everything happen still wasn't clear to us. We started writing our code in C without really thinking about the impact having a GUI would have. C being an old and primitive language did not support graphics natively and to learn to include and use graphics.h header file seemed really cumbersome. 
And after writing about 600 lines of code in C, we decided to shift to python as it was a relatively newer language, and had libraries & modules that supported graphics natively. Along with python we used csv files to maintain the database records, helping us save data in a relatively efficient manner as compared to text/binary files.
Due to lack of time and lack of understanding of python we couldn't make GUI properly, consequently we had to drop the idea of making a GUI.

## Technology Utilised 
* Python
* CSV files
## Problems faced

* The process of writing the entire program in C became really complex and confusing.
* Implementation of GUI seemed almost impossible as there were no modern day libraries or modules in C for graphics.
* Switching to Python, an entirely new language, posed a set of different problems.
* After writing our code for all the features of our program, we went on to make the GUI. While researching about the same we came across the following modules to make a GUI-
    * Tkinter
    * EasyGUI
    * PYQT
    
* One might say that we got a little too ambitious as we weren't aware about the challenges learning a language completely foreign to us would pose. After spending 2 days working with above mentioned modules to implement and make the GUI work, we finally had to give up as we just didn't know python well enough.
